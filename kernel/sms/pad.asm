; pad - read input from MD controller
;
; Conveniently expose an API to read the status of a MD pad A. Moreover,
; implement a mechanism to input arbitrary characters from it. It goes as
; follow:
;
; * Direction pad select characters. Up/Down move by one, Left/Right move by 5\
; * Start acts like Return
; * A acts like Backspace
; * B changes "character class": lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special chars.
;   The space character is the first among special chars.
; * C confirms letter selection
;
; This module is currently hard-wired to sms/vdp, that is, it calls vdp's
; routines during padGetC to update character selection.
