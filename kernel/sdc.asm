; sdc
;
; Manages the initialization of a SD card and implement a block device to read
; and write from/to it, in SPI mode.
;
; Note that SPI can't really be used directly from the z80, so this part
; assumes that you have a device that handles SPI communication on behalf of
; the z80. This device is assumed to work in a particular way. See the
; "rc2014/sdcard" recipe for details.
;
; That device has 3 ports. One write-only port to make CS high, one to make CS
; low (data sent is irrelevant), and one read/write port to send and receive
; bytes with the card through the SPI protocol. The device acts as a SPI master
; and writing to that port initiates a byte exchange. Data from the slave is
; then placed on a buffer that can be read by reading the same port.
;
; It's through that kind of device that this code below is supposed to work.
;
; *** SDC buffers ***
;
; SD card's lowest common denominator in terms of block size is 512 bytes, so
; that's what we deal with. To avoid wastefully reading entire blocks from the
; card for one byte read ops, we buffer the last read block. If a GetB or PutB
; operation is within that buffer, then no interaction with the SD card is
; necessary.
;
; As soon as a GetB or PutB operation is made that is outside the current
; buffer, we load a new block.
;
; When we PutB, we flag the buffer as "dirty". On the next buffer change (during
; an out-of-buffer request or during an explicit "flush" operation), bytes
; currently in the buffer will be written to the SD card.
;
; We hold 2 buffers in memory, each targeting a different sector and with its
; own dirty flag. We do that to avoid wasteful block writing in the case where
; we read data from a file in the SD card, process it and write the result
; right away, in another file on the same card (zasm), on a different sector.
;
; If we only have one buffer in this scenario, we'll end up loading a new sector
; at each GetB/PutB operation and, more importantly, writing a whole block for
; a few bytes each time. This will wear the card prematurely (and be very slow).
;
; With 2 buffers, we solve the problem. Whenever GetB/PutB is called, we first
; look if one of the buffer holds our sector. If not, we see if one of the
; buffer is clean (not dirty). If yes, we use this one. If both are dirty or
; clean, we use any. This way, as long as writing isn't made to random
; addresses, we ensure that we don't write wastefully because read operations,
; even if random, will always use the one buffer that isn't dirty.
