; acia
;
; Manage I/O from an asynchronous communication interface adapter (ACIA).
; provides "aciaPutC" to put c char on the ACIA as well as an input buffer.
; You have to call "aciaInt" on interrupt for this module to work well.
;
; "aciaInit" also has to be called on boot, but it doesn't call "ei" and "im 1",
; which is the responsibility of the main asm file, but is needed.

; *** DEFINES ***
; ACIA_CTL: IO port for the ACIA's control registers
; ACIA_IO: IO port for the ACIA's data registers
; ACIA_RAMSTART: Address at which ACIA-related variables should be stored in
;                RAM.

; *** CONSTS ***
; size of the input buffer. If our input goes over this size, we start losing
; data.
.equ	ACIA_BUFSIZE	0x20

; *** VARIABLES ***
; Our input buffer starts there. This is a circular buffer.
.equ	ACIA_BUF	ACIA_RAMSTART

; The "read" index of the circular buffer. It points to where the next char
; should be read. If rd == wr, the buffer is empty. Not touched by the
; interrupt.
.equ	ACIA_BUFRDIDX	ACIA_BUF+ACIA_BUFSIZE
; The "write" index of the circular buffer. Points to where the next char
; should be written. Should only be touched by the interrupt. if wr == rd-1,
; the interrupt will *not* write in the buffer until some space has been freed.
