; Allows other modules to print to "standard out", and get data from "standard
; in", that is, the console through which the user is connected in a decoupled
; manner.
;
; Those GetC/PutC routines are hooked through defines and have this API:
;
; GetC: Blocks until a character is read from the device and return that
;       character in A.
;
; PutC: Write character specified in A onto the device.
;
; *** Accepted characters ***
;
; For now, we're in muddy waters in this regard. We try to stay close to ASCII.
; Anything over 0x7f is undefined. Both CR and LF are interpreted as "line end".
; Both BS and DEL mean "delete previous character".
;
; When outputting, newlines are marked by CR and LF. Outputting a character
; deletion is made through BS then space then BS.
;
; *** Defines ***
; STDIO_GETC: address of a GetC routine
; STDIO_PUTC: address of a PutC routine

; Size of the readline buffer. If a typed line reaches this size, the line is
; flushed immediately (same as pressing return).
