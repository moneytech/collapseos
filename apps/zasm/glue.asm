; zasm
;
; Reads input from specified blkdev ID, assemble the binary in two passes and
; spit the result in another specified blkdev ID.
;
; We don't buffer the whole source in memory, so we need our input blkdev to
; support Seek so we can read the file a second time. So, for input, we need
; GetB and Seek.
;
; For output, we only need PutB. Output doesn't start until the second pass.
;
; The goal of the second pass is to assign values to all symbols so that we
; can have forward references (instructions referencing a label that happens
; later).
;
; Labels and constants are both treated the same way, that is, they can be
; forward-referenced in instructions. ".equ" directives, however, are evaluated
; during the first pass so forward references are not allowed.

; *** Overridable consts ***
; NOTE: These limits below are designed to be *just* enough for zasm to assemble
; itself. Considering that this app is Collapse OS' biggest app, it's safe to
; assume that it will be enough for many many use cases. If you need to compile
; apps with lots of big symbols, you'll need to adjust these.
; With these default settings, zasm runs with less than 0x1800 bytes of RAM!

; Maximum number of symbols we can have in the global and consts registry
.equ	ZASM_REG_MAXCNT		0xff

; Maximum number of symbols we can have in the local registry
.equ	ZASM_LREG_MAXCNT	0x20

; Size of the symbol name buffer size. This is a pool. There is no maximum name
; length for a single symbol, just a maximum size for the whole pool.
; Global labels and consts have the same buf size
.equ	ZASM_REG_BUFSZ		0x700

; Size of the names buffer for the local context registry
.equ	ZASM_LREG_BUFSZ		0x100
